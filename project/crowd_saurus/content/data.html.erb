While they may not attract as much public attention as the Museum's dinosaurs, the study of fossil mammals (paleomammalogy) has always been a key component of vertebrate paleontology at the AMNH. The museum has approximately 400,000 fossil mammal specimens, representing 46 extinct and extant orders, 2808 extinct genera, and 7599 species housed on seven floors of the Museum's Childs Frick Building. More than half of all the genera of mammals known to science are present in the collection.

Data about the specimens are dispersed across the collection and associated archives, in card catalogs, shipping records, field notes, and maps. In order to provide high quality, georeferenced data to collection users, these disparate data sources are in the process of being consolidated. The transcription of card catalog entries is particularly time and resource intensive. Past projects took scans of catalog cards and had interns transcribe the data on the cards.
