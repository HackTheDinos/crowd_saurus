### About the AMNH Fossil Mammal Type Catalog

The fossil mammal collections at the American Museum of Natural History contain nearly 2,000 primary type specimens (genotypes and holotypes), together with around 1,500 casts of primary types from other institutions (plastotypes). Bob Evander has been undertaking a research project to develop and publish a comprehensive catalog of these primary types for a number of years and a preliminary listing of specimens is now available.

### Digitization and Public Transcription: Bringing New Materials to Light

Some text here describing how this works. You can base your content on the [NYPL Emigrant City Project](http://emigrantcity.nypl.org/#/about).

### About the Software
Project built on an open-source framework called [_Scribe_](http://scribeproject.github.io/) built by NYPL Labs and Zooniverse with generous support National Endowment for the Humanities. Scribe is modeled on the idea, described above, of distributed task flows and multi-user consensus, and is geared toward transcription projects that aim to produce structured data sets. It is designed to be highly configurable and able to handle a wide range of document types with varying structures.
